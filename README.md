# Kings

WIP of the card game Kings Cup/Circle of Death in C#. 
Built against Android 5.1 using the Xamarin framework


Kings Cup uses a full deck of cards, and there's a lot of different version with their own rules.
Essentially cards are dealt in a circle for everyone to choose from; everyone draws one card at a time,
  each card corresponds to a pre-established rule, then the turn moves on to the next player. 
The only need for suits in Kings is to distinguish between red and black, as the color of the drawn card
  effects the rule of the card, ie. drawing a red Queen is different than drawing a black Queen, but 
  drawing a Queen of Hearts and a Queen of Diamonds is the same because both suits are red.
